# intent

**"Who is talking to whom?"** — pure-TypeScript brAIn node that listens to
the bus events emitted by the `voice` and `gaze` nodes, correlates speech
segments with the speaker's gaze direction over a short sliding window,
and publishes a structured `intent.detected` per finalized utterance —
plus `intent.addressed` when the speaker addresses the AI itself.

```
                    ┌──────────── brAIn bus ────────────┐

                    │ intent.addressed   (spoke to the AI → brain)   │

```

## Addressed to the AI: `intent.addressed`

Humans talking among themselves should not wake the LLM. Every
correlated utterance goes out on `intent.detected` (the chat renders
them as reported speech) and accumulates in a context buffer. When an
utterance targets the **camera** — dominant gaze vote, or at least
`camera_min_fraction` (0.4) of the speech window spent looking at the
lens — the node publishes `intent.addressed`:

```jsonc
{
  "question": { /* the addressed intent record */ },
  "context":  [ { "speaker": "Alex", "target_kind": "person",
                  "target_name": "Sam", "text": "…" }, … ],
  "dropped_utterances": 0,
  "camera_overlap_s": 2.9
}
```

`context` is the conversation overheard **since the last addressed
exchange**, most recent kept, capped by `INTENT_CONTEXT_MAX_UTTERANCES`
(20) and `INTENT_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS` (1500). The buffer resets after
each dispatch. The brain subscribes to this topic (see the vocal-chat
seed): it wakes once, with the whole exchange as context, instead of on
every sentence.

Correlation itself is **deferred** by `INTENT_CORRELATE_DEFER_MS`
(3000) after a segment arrives — gaze frames clear the analysis queue a
beat after the speech they belong to — and **retro-runs** whenever a
person is created or updated, so the utterance that triggered an
enrollment is never lost.

## Why pure TS

The previous incarnation was a separate Python+Vite proxy that opened
WebSockets / HTTP polling on the voice and gaze servers from outside the
brAIn process. With voice and gaze now bridging their server events
directly onto the brAIn bus, intent doesn't need to talk to those Python
servers at all — it just subscribes to two topics. No Python runtime,
no separate venv, no extra port, just a small TS node.

## Layers

```
src/store.ts        — better-sqlite3 store (persons, intents) at data/intent.db
src/timeline.ts     — in-memory ring buffer (5 min retention)
src/correlator.ts   — port of the legacy correlator algorithm
src/server.ts       — embedded HTTP + WS server on :8767 for the UI
src/handler.ts      — bus subscriber + lifecycle (onSpawn / teardown)
ui/index.html       — persons CRUD + live intents panel (vanilla HTML)
```

## Endpoints (HTTP server on :8767)

| Method | Path                          | Description |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/health`                 | Status |
| GET    | `/api/persons`                | List linked persons |
| POST   | `/api/persons`                | Create (`{name, color?, voice_profile_id?, gaze_profile_id?}`) |
| PATCH  | `/api/persons/:id`            | Update |
| DELETE | `/api/persons/:id`            | Delete |
| GET    | `/api/intents?limit=N`        | History (newest first) |
| DELETE | `/api/intents`                | Wipe history |
| GET    | `/api/timeline?since=epoch`   | In-memory voice + gaze events |
| GET    | `/api/voice/profiles`         | Proxy to voice :8765 |
| GET    | `/api/gaze/profiles`          | Proxy to gaze :8766 |
| WS     | `/ws/intents`                 | Live intent push (one JSON per detection) |

The same operations are also reachable from the bus via
`intent.persons.{create,update,delete}` messages.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm setup:voice          # one-time: voice server venv + STT models
pnpm setup:gaze           # one-time: gaze server venv + ML models
pnpm dev:intent           # API + dashboard + voice + gaze + intent
                          # http://localhost:5173 → click intent node
```

`dev:intent` seeds three nodes (voice, gaze, intent), so each subsystem's
backing Python server is spawned at node startup and torn down cleanly when
the node is killed (heartbeat + onTeardown — same pattern as voice/gaze).

## Workflow in the UI

1. Start mic capture from the voice node UI, start cam capture from gaze.
2. Once a few voice / face profiles exist (let people speak / appear),
   open the intent UI.
3. Create a person, then bind them to a voice profile (🎙) and a face
   profile (👁) via the dropdowns. Both bindings are required for the
   correlator to credit a segment to a person.
4. When that person speaks, an intent appears in the live feed labeling
   what they are looking at: another person, the camera, a scene
   description (Moondream when describe=ON), or unknown.

## Bus topics

**Subscribes:**
- `voice.transcript` — finalized SegmentEvent metadata
- `gaze.target.resolved` — gaze /api/events row
- `intent.persons.{create,update,delete}` — CRUD via bus

**Publishes:**
- `intent.detected` — one per correlated voice segment
- `intent.addressed` — question + overheard-context delta when a speaker addresses the AI (camera gaze)
- `intent.persons.changed` — `{kind, person}` after CRUD changes
